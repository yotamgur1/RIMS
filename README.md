# RIMS: Ratchet-Based Ion Pump

RIMS, which stands for Ratchet-Based Ion Pump, is a research project conducted by the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department at Tel Aviv University, in the Energy Devices Research Lab under the leadership of Professor Gideon Segev. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a selective ion pump that allows lithium extraction from seawater.

## Project Overview

Our system employs a ratchet mechanism to achieve precise and rapid manipulation of an electric field.
Leveraging differences in the diffusion coefficients of various ions, our system enables efficient ion separation. 

## Code Repository

This repository contains code that simulates the operation of the RIMS system. It also serves as an infrastructure for future AI simulations aimed at optimizing the ratchet's parameters to achieve the most effective ion separation.
